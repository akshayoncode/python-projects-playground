# Project 02: Building a Coffee Machine program

# Summary: 
With this project, I have finished the first 15 days of Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp. This is the beginning of intermediate territory of learning python.
It asks the user for their preferred drink, and then checks if the machine has enough resources to make that drink. If it does, the user is asked to insert enough money to dispense the drink. If the user inserts more than the cost of their drink, remaining change is returned to the user. The machine can also be turned of for maintenance purposes.

# Features:
- Menu with multiple drink options (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
- Ingredient tracking (water, milk, coffee)
- Coin processing (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Checks for sufficient resources before making a drink
- Generates reports of current inventory and money collected
- Option to turn off the machine (`"off"` command)
