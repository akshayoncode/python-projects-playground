# Project 08: Miles to Kilometers Converter

## Project Summary

This project is a simple graphical converter tool that converts distance from miles to kilometers using Python’s `tkinter` module. The user enters a number of miles, clicks "Calculate", and sees the equivalent value in kilometers displayed instantly.

This project was built as part of my ongoing Python learning journey to practice GUI development using Tkinter, event-driven programming, and basic unit conversions.

## Features

- Interactive GUI built with `tkinter`
- User input field for entering miles
- Conversion output rounded to 2 decimal places
- Instant response when the "Calculate" button is clicked
- Clean, minimal layout using the grid system

## How to Run

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

### Steps:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
   cd Project_08_Miles_to_Km_Converter
3. python3 main.py

## Controls
1. Type a number (miles) into the input box.
2. Click the "Calculate" button to see the result in kilometers.

## What I learned
1. How to build a basic GUI using tkinter
2. Creating and positioning widgets using the grid layout
3. Capturing user input and triggering actions with button commands
4. Performing real-time calculations and displaying dynamic output
5. Formatting float output with rounding for clean presentation

## Files
1. main.py – Main program containing the UI and conversion logic

## Future Improvements
1. Add input validation to handle empty or invalid entries
2. Enhance UI styling with custom fonts or color themes
3. Convert kilometers back to miles as a toggle feature
