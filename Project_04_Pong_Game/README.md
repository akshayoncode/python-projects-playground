# Project 04: Pong Game

## Project Summary

This project is a recreation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle graphics module. Two players control paddles to bounce a ball across the screen. The game includes collision detection, scorekeeping, and smooth motion updates using the `turtle` and `time` modules.

This project was built as part of my ongoing Python learning journey to strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming and event-driven development.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay with independent paddle controls
- Ball movement with collision detection against walls and paddles
- Real-time score tracking and display
- Object-oriented design using classes
- Keyboard event handling for player controls

## How to Run

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

### Steps:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
   cd Day_22_Pong_Game
3. python3 main.py

## Controls
1. Player 1 (Left Paddle): W to move up, S to move down
2. Player 2 (Right Paddle): Up and Down arrow keys

## What I learned
1. How to use the turtle module to build interactive graphical applications
2. Handling keyboard input with Python
3. Implementing object-oriented design with multiple classes
4. Managing screen updates and delays for smooth animation

## Files
1. main.py – Entry point and game loop
2. paddle.py – Paddle class logic
3. ball.py – Ball class logic, movement, and collision detection
4. scoreboard.py – Score tracking and display

## Future Improvements
1. Add sound effects
2. Build a single-player version with AI
3. Include a pause or restart button
4. Implement a winning screen or match timer
